I recently published a new plugin to the Wordpress.org Plugins Directory. I
call it _Foresight_. It is available for download here:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/foresight/

Foresight is a simple plugin that serves a simple purpose: it helps blog
administrators to stay current on known exploits for Wordpress and for
Wordpress plugins.

<!--more-->

When you install Foresight, a "Foresight" sub-menu will be added to your admin
menu under "Tools". If you click on that link, you'll see a tabbed window, into
which are loaded several exploit trackers. All but one of these
([1337day.com][]) will display the newest Wordpress exploits by default.  

Here is a screenshot:

Usage
-----
Using this plugin is simple: when you log in to your site to do your typical
admin stuff, take a moment to look through the tabs. If you find new exploits
on plugins that you use on your own blog, take the "appropriate action" (which
may range from doing nothing to uninstalling the plugin).

Foresight's goal is to give you "foresight" into what exploits may be coming
your way, and to give you time to prepare for them. It's [available for free
download in the Wordpress.org Plugin Directory][Foresight], and is also
[mirrored on Github][].
