I spend a lot of time in front of a computer, and thus, a lot of time at a
desk. Because I generally don't like sitting still, and because I recently
learned that [sitting all day can kill you][huffpo], I decided to try to build
a standing desk. I'm documenting here a design that I came up with that is
inexpensive, easy to build, and has proven to be very practical.

I have neither a lot of carpentry experience, nor many carpentry tools, nor any
workshop space, so I designed this desk to take advantage of preexisting
products to the largest degree possible. The desk's primary components are two
of these [ClosetMaid 9-sectional organizers][amazon]:

The above are stackable and reasonably sturdy, so they're perfect for our
purposes.

Beyond that, you'll need two or four angle-irons of any sort.

Let's take a look at the finished product first so you can see where we're
going:

Keep those images in mind if you try to build this thing.

{{< h2 "Build Instructions">}}
The build steps for the desk are fairly straightforward:

(I'm documenting this project after-the-fact, so please forgive me for not
including more "in progress" build pictures. I wasn't sure how this was going
to turn out when I started, and I didn't think ahead to document the build
along the way.)

1. Assemble one of the nine-sectional organizers per the included instructions.
   Make sure not to cap its uppermost slots, because you're going to be stacking
   another one on top of it. (This will make sense when you have the product in
   front of you.)

2. Assemble the second organizer per the instructions, **but do not
   assemble the top row**. Specifically, set aside the topmost long,
   horizontal board which should complete the shelf. Also set aside the two
   shorter "divider" boards which would compartmentalize that shelf into cubes.

3. Stack the two organizers, such that the modified organizer (step #2) sits
   atop the complete organizer from step 1. This completes the vertical backbone
   of the desk.

4. to attach a keyboard tray: fetch the leftover horizontal board set aside
   in step 2. This will form the keyboard tray. Attach this tray using to the
   front of the uppermost organizer using the angle irons, per the photographs:

(Make sure to position the keyboard tray at the appropriate height for your
body. I personally found it to be the most comfortable when it was mounted just
an inch or two beneath my elbows when standing in a relaxed position in front
of the desk.)

5. Optionally bracket the two remaining short "divider" boards to the sides
   of the desk, per the photographs. (I use these for storage and charging
   stations, and I find them pretty handy. Speakers or whatever could presumably
   be mounted here as well.)

That's it! Then you just need to situate your monitors, computers, tablets,
etc. I find that the top shelf is just wide enough to accommodate my [Samsung
Series 9][install-lubuntu] side-by-side with a widescreen monitor (not shown).
The cubbies are also extremely helpful for storing miscellaneous tech, coffees,
etc. I find them to be pretty handy - one of the desk's key "unplanned
features".

{{< h2 "Final Thoughts">}}
I advise you to use the bottom organizer as a bookshelf or something, or
otherwise find a way to anchor the desk to the ground. It has a high
center-of-gravity otherwise, and is a bit unstable. Anchor it down carefully so
you don't crush yourself or your tech.
