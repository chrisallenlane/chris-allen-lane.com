I've been working on a tool that I call "Watchtower" for the last several
weeks. Watchtower is a platform- and language-agnostic [Static Code Analysis][]
tool that can be used for code audits and incident-response. <!--more--> The
project is hosted here:

https://github.com/chrisallenlane/watchtower

Check out the README to get a feel for how it works.

In the meantime, that's all I can say, because I'm hoping to publish a more
detailed introduction in an upcoming issue of _2600_. If that submission is
rejected, more details will later be made available here.

Update: 15 Apr 2015

The aforementioned article was published in _2600_ magazine, Volume 30, Number
2 in Summer of 2013. [You may read a reprint of the article in full
