Recently I decided to purchase a headset to allow me to be heard more clearly
when using Skype. Given that I'm also a casual gamer (PS3, primarily), I
figured a headset that would also be compatible with the Playstation 3 would be
ideal.

After looking around (at length) at the options, I decided to go with [Sony's
Wireless Stereo Headset][amazon], which is produced specifically for the PS3. I
wasn't sure if it was going to be Linux-compatible or not, but now, after
having used it for a while, I can say with confidence that it is.

Linux compatibility worked out of the box. (I'll note here that I'm still
running [Ubuntu 11.04 on my Samsung Series 9][install-lubuntu]). I didn't have
to tweak any audio settings, conf files, or download any packages. I just had
to insert the USB wireless adapter, switch over to the headset in Sound
Preferences, and everything worked great.

By way of a general review: while I'm not an audiophile, the sound quality on
the headset strikes me as pretty good. The microphone clarity is excellent (far
better than my phone, I'm told), and the battery life does seem to last the
advertised 8 hours or so. They're comfortable to wear, have a well thought-out
design (convenient mute button, retractable mic, etc), and the wireless range
seems to be 20 or 30 feet or so.
